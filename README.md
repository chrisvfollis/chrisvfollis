## Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm interested in science & engineering in business contexts. I have a passion for automation,
problem solving, and using data to uncover patterns/insights & optimize processes.

* I'm spearheading a data initiative for Xtravel Suspension. This involves analyzing
oscilloscope data from performance tests recorded onto a Raspberry Pi-based solution I engineered to satisfy
the constraints of the project.
* I'm learning data science in Python from Bloom Institute of Technology.
* I'm currently a STEM student and the president of the science club at Lake Tahoe Community
College, and plan to transfer to an engineering-focused university.
