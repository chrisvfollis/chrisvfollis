## Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm interested in science & engineering in business contexts. I have a passion for automation,
problem solving, and using data to uncover patterns & optimize processes.

* I'm spearheading a data initiative for Xtravel Technology. This involves analyzing
oscilloscope data from performance tests recorded onto a Raspberry Pi-based **solution I engineered** within
the technical & budgetary constraints of the project.
* I'm studying **data science** in Python from Bloom Institute of Technology.
* I was a STEM student and the **president of the science club** at Lake Tahoe Community
College, and plan to transfer to an engineering-focused university.
